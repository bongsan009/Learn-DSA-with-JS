# Recursive

Recursive is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

## Exercise:

**Try to solve the the following exercises using recusive only.**

```
1. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number.
2. Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers.
3. Write a program to get integers in the range.
4. Write a to compute the sum of an array of integers.
5. Write a program to compute the exponent of a number.
6. Write a program to get the first n fib numbers.
7. Check whether a number is even or odd.
9. Implement a Binary search.
10. Implement a Merge sort.
11. Check whether a string is a plindrome or not.
12. Find the max element in an Array.
13. Reverse a string.
```
